                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I am a life-long Kentuckian and Louisville transplant. I grew up in Logan County and received my Bachelor's degree in English from Western Kentucky University. After taking a few years off to get married and start a family, I received my Juris Doctor from the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>While working at a family law firm after admission to the bar, I was assigned to work on a case involving ownership of cryo-preserved embryos and fell down a rabbit hole of fertility law and assisted reproductive technology law. Fascinated, I decided to devote my practice to this niche area. Since then, I have been fortunate to play a small role in helping numerous individuals and couple create the family they've always dreamed of.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I am a staunch supporter and advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights. I believe that no matter your marital status, gender identity, or sexual orientation, love is a human right.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>When I am not working, I enjoy reading, painting, and watching a variety of sports, from football to Formula 1. I live with my husband, two children, and three dogs.</p>
